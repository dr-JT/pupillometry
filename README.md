# pupillometry

An R Package to preprocess pupil data

The package contains various functions for different steps in the preprocessing pipeline, such as interpolation or baseline correction.

The pre-processing steps are based on what has commonly been used in the literature and influenced by sensible preprocessing methods suggested by

Math√¥t, S., Fabius, J., Van Heusden, E., & Van der Stigchel, S. (2018). Safe and sensible preprocessing and baseline correction of pupil-size data. Behavior research methods, 50(1), 94-106.

## Eyetracker Support

The format and organization of the raw data file will depend on the type of Eyetracker used. The `tidy_eyetracker()` function imports the "messy" raw data file and it's output is a "tidy" raw data file with standardized column and value labels to be used by the other functions. 

Currently, `tidy_eyetracker()` only supports data exported from BeGaze using an SMI eye-tracker. Support for other eye-trackers will be included in future updates.

## Usage

**`preprocess()` is a wrapper around the other functions to allow full preprocessing of pupil data using a single function.**

As such, you will need to pass many arguments to the preprocess() function that specifies all the details and preprocessing options.

The overall workflow of `preprocess()` is:

For each eyetracking file in a specified directory

1. **Convert** "messy" raw data file to a standardized "tidy" raw data file
2. **Save** the "tidy" raw data file
3. Set and evaluate amount of **missing samples** per trial
4. Correlate left and right pupil size (If both eyes were recorded from)
5. Choose to keep only left or right pupil data (If both eyes were recorded from)
6. Set **Timing** variable to be relative to onset of each trial
7. **Save** data at this stage*
8. **Interpolate**
9. **Save** data at this stage*
10. **Smooth**
11. **Save** data at this stage*

\* When data is saved at these stages the following preprocessing steps may follow:
1. **Baseline Correct**
2. **Down Sample**

What this does is saves a data file at each stage of preprocessing. That way you have a baseline corrected/downsampled file at each stage of pre-processing. This can be useful if you originally specified a pre-processing step, such as smoothing, but then later decide you do not want to use that pre-processing method - you will already have the pre-processed (including baseline correction/down sampling) data file prior to that step. Or you may wish to compare how your results change depending on what pre-processing steps you perform.
