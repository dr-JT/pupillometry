> An R Package to preprocess pupil data

The package contains various functions for different steps in the preprocessing pipeline, such as interpolation, smoothing, and baseline correction.

The pre-processing steps are based on what has commonly been used in the literature and influenced by sensible preprocessing methods suggested by

Math√¥t, S., Fabius, J., Van Heusden, E., & Van der Stigchel, S. (2018). Safe and sensible preprocessing and baseline correction of pupil-size data. Behavior research methods, 50(1), 94-106.

The main goal of this package is to provide:

1) ease of use for pupillometry researchers

2) flexibility in choosing which preprocessing methods and parameters are used. 

## Install

```r
devtools::install_github("dr-JT/pupillometry")
```

## Eyetracker Support

The format and organization of the raw data file will depend on the type of Eyetracker used. The `read_pupil()` function imports the "messy" raw data file and it's output is a "tidy" raw data file with standardized column and value labels to be used by the other functions. 

Currently, `read_pupil()` only supports data exported from BeGaze using an SMI eye-tracker. Support for other eye-trackers will be included in future updates.

## Usage

**`preprocess()` is a wrapper around the other functions to allow full preprocessing of pupil data using a single function.**

As such, you will need to pass many arguments to the `preprocess()` function that specifies all the details and preprocessing options.

`preprocess()` will be performed on an entire `import.dir` directory of raw data files that match a certain `pattern`. At various stages of preprocessing the data will be saved to a specified `output.dir` directory.

The overall workflow of `preprocess()` is:

1. **Read** in raw data files `read_pupil()`
2. Clean up raw data files and more
    - **Correlate** left and right pupil size (if both eyes were recorded from). `pupil_cor()`
    - **Select** either left or right pupil data (if both eyes were recorded from). `select_eye()`
    - Set **Timing** variable to be relative to onset of each trial. `set_timing()`
3. **De-blink** data. `pupil_deblink()`
4. **Smooth** (if specified). `pupil_smooth()`
5. **Interpolate** (if specified). `pupil_interpolate()`
6. **Baseline Correct** (if specified). `pupil_baselinecorrect()`
7. Remove trials with too much **Missing Data**. `pupil_missing()`

A final preprocessed data file will be saved for every original raw data file.

If `output.steps == TRUE` a data file will be saved after steps 3, 4, and 5. Before saving the data file at each of these steps, the final two steps 6 and 7 are performed. This results in baseline corrected and missing data removed files before each major preprocessing step. This is obviously not necessary and so `output.steps = FALSE` can be set to only save on final preprocessed data file per subject. 

### Script Template

You can copy and paste the following code into a script and use it as a template.

```r
