\description{
This function converts a "messy" raw eye-tracker data file
to a "tidy" raw data file.
}
\details{
Different eye-trackers will save the raw data file using
completely different organizations and naming conventions
This function will create a "tidy" raw data file that has
a standard organization and naming convention,
regardless of which eye-tracker was used.
Supported Eye-Tracker Systems: Sensomotoric Instruments ("smi")
and SR-Research EyeLink ("eyelink")
}
