Description: The package contains various functions for different steps in the 
    preprocessing pipeline of pupil data, such as interpolation or baseline 
    correction. The pupil_preprocess() function is wrapper around the other 
    functions to allow preprocessing of an entire folder containing individual 
    raw pupil time series data all with one function.
