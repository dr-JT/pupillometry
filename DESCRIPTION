Description: The package contains various functions for different steps in the preprocessing 
    pipeline of pupil data, such as interpolation or baseline correction. The preprocess() 
    function is wrapper around the other functions to allow preprocessing of an entire folder
    containing individual raw pupil time series data in one line of code.
