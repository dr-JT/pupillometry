**`pupil_preprocess()` is a wrapper around the other functions to allow full preprocessing of raw pupil data using a single function.**

Using this method, you will need to pass many arguments to the `pupil_preprocess()` function that specifies all the details and preprocessing options.

`pupil_preprocess()` will be performed on an entire `import_dir` directory of raw data files that match a certain `pattern` in their filename. The preprocessed data will be saved to a specified `output_dir` directory.

## Workflow

The overall workflow of `pupil_preprocess()` is:

1. **Read** in raw data files `pupil_read()`

    - If `tracking_file` is supplied will also add message markers to the data
    
2. Clean up raw data files and more

    - Set **Timing** variable to be relative to onset of each trial. `set_timing()`

    - **Correlate** left and right pupil size (if both eyes were recorded from). `pupil_cor()`
    
    - **Select** either left or right pupil data (if both eyes were recorded from). `select_eye()`
    
3. **Deblink** data. `pupil_deblink()`

4. **Smooth** (if specified). `pupil_smooth()`

5. **Interpolate** (if specified). `pupil_interpolate()`

6. **Baseline Correct** (if specified). `pupil_baselinecorrect()`

7. Remove trials with too much **Missing Data**. `pupil_missing()`

8. **Merges** files into a single merged file (if specified). `pupil_merge()`

A final preprocessed data file will be saved for every original raw data file.

If `output_steps == TRUE` a data file will be saved after steps 3, 4, and 5. Before saving the data file at each of these steps, the final two steps 6 and 7 are performed. This results in baseline corrected and missing data removed files before each major preprocessing step. This is obviously not necessary and so `output_steps = FALSE` is the default and will only save one final preprocessed data file per subject. Saving a data file after each preprocessing steps would allow you to analyze your data at different stages to assess the influence of the preprocessing methods you chose.

## Message Markers

You will need to supply message markers to correctly preprocess your data. This image is a representation of what the message markers `start_tracking.message`, `trial_onset.message`, and `bc_onset.message` correspond to. For further detail see [Example Data Set](https://dr-jt.github.io/pupillometry/articles/example_data.html) and [Message Markers](https://dr-jt.github.io/pupillometry/articles/message_markers.html) Articles.

## GUI Window

To call the GUI window execute the function in your console

```{r eval = FALSE}
library(pupillometry)
pupil_gui()
```

You will see the following window:

For any of the parameters that do not apply to your data or preprocessing steps, then you can just leave them blank

You can both execute the `pupil_preprocess()` function from the GUI itself and/or, based on the information you entered, you can copy and paste the generated R code into an R script file and save it. I highly suggest you save an R script - that way you can easily go back and change or assess what parameters you specified.
